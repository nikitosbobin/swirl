Swirl
======

A simple, animated icon to use when interacting with the fingerprint reader.

Usage
-----

Swirl does not provide default colors, so you must specify them in your theme.

```xml
<style name="Theme.YourApp" parent="@android:style/Theme.Material.Light">
  <item name="swirl_ridgeColor">?android:attr/textColorSecondary</item>
  <item name="swirl_errorColor">?android:attr/colorAccent</item>
</style>
```

Then, you may include `SwirlView` anywhere in your app.

```xml
<com.mattprecious.swirl.SwirlView
    android:layout_width="60dp"
    android:layout_height="60dp"
    />
```

Note that this example specifies a width and height and does not use `wrap_content`. Swirl
uses vector drawables and does not have a default size, so you must specify one.

Switch between icons by calling `setState()` or by using the `app:swirl_state` attribute.

See the provided sample for a complete implementation.
